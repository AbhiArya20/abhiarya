We prioritize security highly at [abhiarya](https://abhiarya.in). If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please
do not disclose them publicly.

Instead, we encourage you to take the following steps:

- If you are able to resolve the issue, please create a pull request (PR) with the fix.

- Alternatively, you can reach out directly to the project maintainers by contacting me via
  [twitter](https://x.com/AbhiArya200) or [email](mailto:github.abhiarya@gmail.com).

Your contribution helps us ensure that the project remains secure and reliable for everyone.

Thank you for your cooperation and attention to security!
